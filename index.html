<div class="whoami">
<p> I am a 20 year old student from Auckland, New Zealand currently studying towards a Bachelor of Design Innovation, majoring in Interaction Design at Victoria University in Wellington. At this stage, I have completed two years of my degree and I am heading in to my third and final year. I enjoy a wide range of design work. However, I paticularly find interest in the field of human-centered design and the idea of designing completely with the user in mind. I believe in designing WITH people rather than FOR people.  </p>
