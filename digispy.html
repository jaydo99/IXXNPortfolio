<div class="brief">
<p> Digispy was a project I worked on for the Internet Design course at university. For this project, we required to create a product or publishment which contributed to the internet culture and related to the content we learnt in the course regaring the internet. For this, I opted to focus on the issue of data harvesting after being inspired by the Cambridge Analytica scandal.   </p>

<p> The idea behind DIGISPY was to create something that would get people thinking about where their online data goes, and what it is used for. I wanted to push the idea that ultimately our internet activity ends up somewhere, rather than the common misbelief that it simply vanishes after logging off. Therefore, I decided to pitch the idea of creating a browser-extension called DIGISPY, which visually reflects internet activity back at the user as they use the web.  </p>
<br>
<p> For this project, I was only required to pitch a prototype of the idea. Therefore, I created a website to present the idea and used javascript to make a prototype of the browser extension. In order to make the website, I went through a branding process to figure out the visual direction of the brand and designed a logo for the product.I also used adobe-effects to make a video to pitch how the extension would work.  </p>

<p> Through this project, I learnt how to think abstractly and come up with an idea to push a purpose. I also developed skills on branding aswell as improving on technical skills such as coding html and css. This was also the first time using javascript for a project which helped me to improve in my javascript ability. </p>
